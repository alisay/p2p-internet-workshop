# Welcome Email

Hello,

We are excited for the first Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet workshop, and we hope you are too! The workshops run on Tuesdays, August 2, 9, 23 and 30 from 5:30-7:30 p.m. at Bunbury Regional Art Gallery. Here are a few notes to get you ready for the first session.

1. Please complete the pre-workshop survey [ link to survey ]. We use this to set the pace of the workshop and, together with a post-workshop survey, to assess how it went in order to improve for future sessions.
2. Make sure you have administrator privileges on your laptop. 
3. We will be using an SSH client and Text Editor software. You likely already have it installed on your computer. Set up instructions can be found at https://github.com/alisay/p2p-internet-workshop/blob/bunbury/SETUP.md

If you have any trouble, send us an email at hi@alisa.pizza or come a little early Tuesday August 2 before the class.

If you are no longer able to attend, please let us know at hi@alisa.pizza so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waitlist.
